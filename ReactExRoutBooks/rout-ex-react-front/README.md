- Axios is a promise-based HTTP client that works both in the browser and in a node.js environment. It basically provides a single API for dealing with XMLHttpRequests and node’s http interface. Besides that, it wraps the requests using a polyfill for ES6 new’s promise syntax. Get it like this: "npm install axios --save"
